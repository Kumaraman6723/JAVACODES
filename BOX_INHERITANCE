/*Program Statement
     Define a class Box with the following instance variables: width, height and depth, all of type float. Create a new class BoxWeigth that extends Box to include weight as an instance variable. Write an application that tests the functionalities of both these classes.
Definition of Done:
DoD 1: Three java files to be defined. One for each class definition: Box, BoxWeight and BoxWeightDemo.
DoD 2:  Box and BoxWeight should have three types of constructors defined: clone of an object, all dimensions specified as arguments, no argument.
DoD 3: Super is used to call base class constructors in derived class
DoD 4: Get and set functions defined as applicable in Box and BoxWeight classes.
DoD 5: Function to display volume in Box class and weight in BoxWeigth class*/
